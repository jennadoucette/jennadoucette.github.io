    <h2>some basic info</h2>
    <p class="middle">so <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple">apples</a> right, theyre a  type of fruit produced by a tree. </p>
    <p>they are the most commonly grown species in the genus malus </p>
    <p>Theyre cultivated world wide but the tree originated in central asia.</p> 
    <p>their wild ancestor, malus sieversii is still found there today</p>
    <p>They have been grown for thousands of years in asia and europe and were brought to the americas by european colonists.</p> 
    <p>trees and fruit are prone to a number of fungal, bacterial and pest problems, which can be controlled by a number of organic and non-organic means. in 2010, the fruit's genome was sequenced as part of research on disease control and selective breeding in apple production</p>
    <h2>religious aspect</h2>
    <p>apples have religious and mythological significance in many cultures such as norse, greek, and european christian tradition</p>
    <h2>more basic facts</h2>
    <p>apple trees can be big if theyre grown from seed (but there are bonsai <a href="https://www.bonsaitreegardener.net/bonsai-trees/species/apple">bonsai apple trees</a> which are exceptionally small, actually produce mini apple fruits, and i love them) </p>

    <p>apple cultivatars are propagated by grafting onto rootsocks which control the size of the resulting tree (ie, bonsai apple trees)</p>
    <p>there are more than 7500 different types of apples, and they all taste different and some are better for cooking or eating or making cider from</p>
    <h2>world stat of 2014</h2>
