<h2>fruit facts</h2>
<p class="middle">i hope you like  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit">fruit facts</a> because that's all this will talk about. </p>
<p class ="middle">fruit is defined as a seed bearing structure in flowering plants (also known as angiosperms) formed from the ovary after flowering. fruits are the means by which angiosperms disseminate seeds. </p> 
<p class ="middle">edible fruits have propagated with the movements of humans and animals in a symbiotic relationship as a means for seed dispersal and nutrition; in fact humans and many animals have become dependent on fruits as a source of food. 
<p class ="middle">accordingly, fruits account for a substantial fraction of the world's agricultural output, and some have acquired extensive cultural and symbolic meanings, see <a href="apple.html">apples</a> or <a href="pomegranate.html">pomegranates.</a> </p>
<p class="middle">there will be facts on <a href="apples.html">apples,</a> <a href="grapefruit.html">grapefruit,</a> <a href="pomegranate.html">pomegranate,</a>  and <a href="grapes.html">grapes</a></p>
<h2>jenna's opinions</h2>
<p class="middle">grapes and apples are the supreme fruits. i have had pomegranate like twice in my life and i didn't like it very much BUT it was a lot better than what (in my humble opinion) is the world's worst fruit (my opinion is correct), which is grapefruit.</p>
<p class="middle">apologies for any spelling errors in this, i am awful at spelling as well as typing</p>
<p class="middle">my website looks like a barren waste land so i am trying to fill up more space but there isn't much to say about fruit. other people have very info packed websites so i feel like i should as well but nah</p>
<p class="middle">fruit is pretty tasty</p>
<p class="middle">i am running out of things to say so this is unfortunate</p>
<h2>another fruit fact</h2>
<p class="middle">anyway, there roughly 2000 types of fruit in the world</p>
<p class="middle">the western world uses only about 10 percent of these</p>
<h2>feel free to ignore</h2>
<p class="middle">okay please continue i am done, go peruse my suuuuuuper interesting website, thank you have a great day</p>
<p class = "middle"> I think its really cute that you brought this up, however stop looking at my crappy website mo</p>
